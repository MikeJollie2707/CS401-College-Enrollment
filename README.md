# College Enrollment Group Project

Source code for CS 401 group project.

## Setup

Clone this repo into the current working directory (make sure it's empty). There's a dot at the end.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MikeJollie2707/CS401-College-Enrollment.git .
```

...or use any GUI (like GitHub Desktop) to do this.

In Eclipse, open this project with `File > Open Projects from File System`. Select the directory to be where you cloned the project. Select `Finish`.

Don't push to `main`. At the very least, create a separate branch and do whatever with that one.
