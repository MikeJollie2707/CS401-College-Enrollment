# College Enrollment Group Project

Source code for CS 401 group project.

## Note

1. Don't push/merge directly to `main`. At the very least, create a separate branch and do the work on that one. To modify `main`, create a PR and wait for approval.
    - Feel free to ping in Discord for approval. If no one response after a day, go ahead and merge it yourself.
    - After merging to `main`, delete the old branch. Create another branch for further changes.
2. Don't modify/delete public commits (commits that show up on GitHub basically). Use `git revert` to safely reverse a public commit.
3. Avoid creating a branch from another non-`main` branch.

## Setup

Clone this repo into the current working directory (make sure it's empty). There's a dot at the end.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MikeJollie2707/CS401-College-Enrollment.git .
```

...or use any GUI (like GitHub Desktop) to do this.

In Eclipse, open this project with `File > Open Projects from File System`. Select the directory to be where you cloned the project. Select `Finish`.

To view Git history, right-click on the project, choose `Show In` (not `Show In Local Terminal`) then select `History`. Then tinker around that view until it shows all history for both local branches and remote branches.
